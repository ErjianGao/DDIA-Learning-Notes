* We call an application data-intensive if data is its primary challenge—the quantity of data, the complexity of data, or the speed at Preface | xiii which it is changing—as opposed to compute-intensive, where CPU cycles are the bottleneck.
* we will look at examples of successful data systems: technologies that form the foundation of many popular applications and that have to meet scalability, performance, and reliability require‐ ments in production every day.
* We look primarily at the architecture of data systems and the ways they are integrated into data-intensive applications.
